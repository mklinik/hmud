HOWTO setup ejabberd for testing
================================

- install ejabberd

- the default debian ejabberd configuration, found in
  /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.cfg, starts a jabber server serving localhost. It has
  group chat enabled by default.

- to enable account registration, change the line
    {access, register, [{deny, all}]}.
  to
    {access, register, [{allow, all}]}.

- set registration timeout to some lower value (time is obviously in seconds)
    {registration_timeout, 10}.

- restart ejabberd

- use a jabber client to create some users
