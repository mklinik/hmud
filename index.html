    <h1><a href="https://github.com/mklinik/hmud">The Tower</a></h1>

    <div class="description">
      A multi-player text game, to be played in jabber chat rooms.
    </div>

    <h2>What's it?</h2>

    <p><em>The Tower</em> is a text adventure that is supposed to jazz up
    jabber group chats. It doesn't have many features though. You can walk
    around, stare at the landscape and at other people, pick up items and give
    items to other players. There are no quests and there is no combat.
    <em>The Tower</em> doesn't want to distract you too much from your regular
    slavery, it just wants to generate some amusing chat messages
    occasionally.</p>

    <p>You play the game by chatting with a special participant in the group
    chat, called the <em>oracle</em>.  The oracle tells you what happens around
    you, what you see, and what other players do.  You tell the oracle what you
    want to do by sending chat messages that start with certain words, called
    <em>commands</em>.  For example, if you are someplace and there is an apple
    lying about, you say "take apple", and the oracle tells you that, whoa, you
    are now in possession of a healthy, sweet, juicy apple. How cool is
    that!</p>
    
    <h2>How to participate</h2>
    
    <p>Just join a jabber group chat where somebody has already started an
    oracle. Or ask your local nerds to start one for you, if you don't know how
    to do it yourself. Anyway, join the chat room and you will see the oracle
    as participant in the group chat.  If it is the first time that you enter
    the group chat, the oracle will create a new character for you, and greet
    you with a private message.  Open that message and start playing!</p>

    <p>If you already have a character, i.e. you have been in that chat room
    before, then you have to open a private conversation window with the oracle
    yourself.  Do so by double-clicking the name of the oracle in the list of
    participants of the group chat.</p>

    <p>Look at the sceenshot below. To the right, you see the group chat window
    that has the list of participants. On the left, you see the privat chat
    window with the oracle. The left window opened when I double-clicked the
    oracle's entry in the right window. Depending on which jabber client you
    use, the windows might look a bit different.</p>

    <p>Please note that you can't put the oracle in your contact list. All
    conversation with the oracle must happen via personal group-chat
    messages.</p>

    <h2>How to decline participation</h2>

    <p>If you don't want to participate in the game, don't join the groupchat
    where the oracle is.</p>

    <p>If you join a group chat because you want to chat with the people there,
    not with a stupid computer game, and the oracle annoys you to no end, you
    can make it shut up by blocking all messages from the oracle. Depending on
    the jabber client you are using, there should be some way to ignore the
    oracle.  Try right-clicking the oracle's entry in the list of participants.
    Most jabber clients offer a context menu entry to ignore a particular
    person.</p>

    <p>But keep in mind that this makes the oracle very sad. You don't want to
    make the oracle sad, do you?! DO YOU???</p>

    <p>Hint: you can unblock the oracle at any time again.</p>

    <h2>Screenshot</h2>

    <p>Here is a conversation with the oracle, you see the messages that a
    player sends to the oracle, and the responses.</p>

    <h2>Commands</h2>

    Commands are these special words that let you perform actions in The Tower.
    Send a chat message to the oracle that starts with one of the command
    words, and watch how mysterious powers do your bidding and modify the game
    world!

    <p>Note: commands and names of things can be abbreviated. If you are in a
    location where another location named "Forest" is adjacent, the commands

    <pre>goto Forest</pre>

    and

    <pre>go For</pre>

    do the same thing.</p>

  <h3>Without further ado, on to the list of commands</h3>

  <pre>help commands</pre>

    List all available commands.

  <pre>lookat</pre>

    Describes your immediate surroundings.

  <pre>lookat &lt;name&gt;</pre>

    Describes items or players.

  <pre>goto &lt;location-name&gt;</pre>

    Go to a different location.

  <pre>inventory</pre>

    List your possessions.

  <pre>take &lt;item-name&gt;</pre>

    Pick up an item.

  <pre>put &lt;item-name&gt;</pre>

    Put down an item.

  <pre>forge &lt;name&gt; $ &lt;description&gt;</pre>

    <p>Create a new item. Note that the dollar sign must be surrounded by
    spaces.  To use this command, you need to have a <em>scroll of forgery</em>
    in your inventory. How to get one, you ask? Play the game, chat with the
    other players and if you are nice to them, somebody might eventually give
    one to you.</p>

    <p>If you finally get your scroll of forgery, keep in mind that items and
    their descriptions are what make the game amusing. Be creative, don't be
    rude. And always remember: With great power comes great responsibility.</p>

    <p>Can you forge a new scroll of forgery? Of course you can! Just forge an
    item whose name is <em>scroll of forgery</em>, and there you go!</p>

  <pre>delete &lt;item-name&gt;</pre>

    Delete an item. Use this command to get rid of all the crappy stuff you
    forged when you were still a sorcerer's apprentice. However, think twice
    before discarding the last scroll of forgery in the game.

  <pre>give &lt;item-name&gt; to &lt;player-name&gt;</pre>

    Give an item to another player.

  <pre>say &lt;text&gt;</pre>

    Say something and everybody in your current location will hear it.

  <pre>tell &lt;player-name&gt; $ &lt;text&gt;</pre>

    Say something that only one other player can hear.

  <pre>me &lt;text&gt;</pre>

    Do something and everybody in your current room will see it. For example,
    if I would utter the words <em>me jumps for joy</em>, everybody in my
    current location would get a message <em>Markus Klinik jumps for joy</em>
