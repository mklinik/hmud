    <h1><a href="https://github.com/mklinik/hmud">The Tower</a></h1>

    <div class="description">
      A multi-player text game, to be played in jabber chat rooms.
    </div>

    <h2>What's it?</h2>

    <p><em>The Tower</em> is a text adventure that is supposed to jazz up
    jabber group chats. You can't do much: walk around, stare at the landscape
    and at other people, pick up items and give items to other players. There
    are no quests and there is no fighting. <em>The Tower</em> doesn't want to
    distract you too much from your daily slavery, just generate some funny
    chat messages for you occasionally.</p>

    <p>You play the game by chatting with a special participant in the group
    chat, the <em>oracle</em>.  The oracle tells you what happens around you,
    what you see, and what other players do.  You tell the oracle what you want
    to do by sending chat messages that start with certain words, called
    <em>commands</em>.  For example, if you are someplace and there is an apple
    lying about, you say "take apple" to the oracle, and the oracle tells you
    that, whoa, you are now in possession of a healthy, sweet, juicy apple. How
    cool is that!</p>
    
    <h2>How to participate?</h2>
    
    <p>Just join a jabber group chat where somebody has already started an
    oracle. You will see the oracle as participant in the group chat. If it is
    the first time that you entered the group chat, the oracle will create a
    new character for you, and greet you with a private message. Open that
    message and start playing!</p>

    <p>If you already have a character, i.e. you have been in that chat room
    before, then you have to open a private conversation window with the oracle
    yourself.  Do so by double-clicking the name of the oracle in the list of
    participants of the group chat.</p>

    <p>Please note that you can't put the oracle in your contact list. All
    conversation with the oracle must happen via personal group-chat
    messages.</p>

    <h2>How NOT to participate?</h2>

    <p>If you join a group chat because you want to chat with the people there,
    not with a stupid computer game, and the oracle annoys you to no end, just
    shut it up by blocking all messages from the oracle. Depending on the
    jabber client you are using, there should be some way to ignore the oracle.
    Try right-clicking the oracle in the list of participants. Most jabber
    clients offer a context menu entry to ignore a particular person.</p>


    <p>But keep in mind that this makes the oracle very sad. You don't want to
    make the oracle sad, do you?! DO YOU???</p>

    <h2>Screenshots</h2>

    <p>Here is a conversation with the oracle, you see the messages that a
    player sends to the oracle, and the response.</p>
