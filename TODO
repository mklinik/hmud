- find a way to connect to server via SSL, possibly by patching XMPP.openStream
  to take a handle, which you connect to ncat before
- map jabber IDs to player names: messages may come from
 - the groupchat: gtf@conference.localhost/markus.klinik
 - direct chat: markus.klinik@localhost/Gajim
 - in both cases, the sender ID must map to "Markus Klinik"
- have a mapping between jabber IDs and player names
- different jabber IDs can map to the same player name
- the sender's resource in a group chat message is the nickname!
- get the jabber ID to a groupchat nick!
- BUT! send the reply to the sender, no matter how you got the request
- So here is how it should work:
   - register for groupchat presence stanzas XMPP.MUC.isGroupchatPresence
   - parse stanza with doGroupchatPresence to get the jabber ID
   - handle NickChange to keep track of nick changes
   - anonymous participants can't play

- How can I have one thread handle different kinds of stanzas?
 - wait for any stanza with (const True)
 - dispatch yourself
